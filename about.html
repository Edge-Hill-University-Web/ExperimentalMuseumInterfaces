                <h1>About Experimental Museum Interfaces (EMI)</h1>
                <p>The Experimental Museum Interfaces (EMI) website is a research platform dedicated to exploring how technology can transform the way users interact with museum collections. Our goal is to design and test innovative interfaces that enhance the value, enjoyment, and accessibility of cultural artefacts, allowing users to discover, explore, and engage with collections in novel ways.</p>
                <h2>Our Research Focus</h2>
                <p>EMI is at the forefront of research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a particular focus on generous interfaces, collection browsing, and recommendation systems for cultural heritage. Our work aims to push beyond traditional search-based interactions, offering users multiple entry points and pathways to experience museum collections. By rethinking how collections are presented and interacted with, we strive to create tools and experiences that make museum visits more meaningful and enjoyable.</p>
                <h2>Types of Experiments</h2>
                <p>Our experiments cover a range of topics, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generous Browsing Interfaces: Designs that allow users to explore a wealth of information upfront, encouraging serendipitous discovery.</li>
                    <li>Interactive Timelines: Tools that help users navigate collections through historical contexts, following the journey of artefacts over time.</li>
                    <li>Recommendation Systems: Personalised suggestions based on user interactions, providing customised paths through the collections.</li>
                    <li>Visualisation Techniques: Testing different ways of displaying artefacts and metadata to uncover connections and relationships between objects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These experiments are continuously evolving, informed by user feedback and data analysis to refine and improve our approaches.</p>
                <h3>The People Behind EMI - The Team</h3>
                <p>Our team comprises researchers, designers, and technologists dedicated to creating valuable, engaging museum experiences for a wide range of users.</p>
                <p>EMI is primarily led by Dr. David Walsh and Dr. Daniel Campbell from Edge Hill University. Their work drives the platformâ€™s development and ongoing research efforts. However, EMI also collaborates with other contributors who bring additional expertise and perspectives to our projects, ensuring a diverse and dynamic approach to exploring museum interfaces.</p>
