                        <h1>Exploring the Future of Museum Website Interactions</h1>
                        <p>Welcome to the Experimental Museum Interfaces (EMI) platform, where we explore new ways to engage with museum collections. Our research focuses on designing innovative interfaces that make interactions with vast collections more valuable, enjoyable, and intuitive. By rethinking how users search, browse, and experience collections, we aim to push the boundaries of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in museum contexts.</p>
                        <p>EMI is a hub for collaborative research. It serves as both a resource for ongoing academic work and a test bed for experimental approaches. Here, you’ll find an evolving collection of experiments that explore different ways to interact with museum collections, driven by principles of generous interfaces, rich prospect browsers, and recommendation systems.</p>

                        <p>This research explores how generous interfaces—designs that present a wealth of information up front without requiring users to initiate a search—can improve the user experience of browsing large museum collections. The study focuses on how such interfaces enable users to discover hidden or overlooked artefacts, facilitating serendipitous exploration. By comparing traditional search-driven interfaces with generous interfaces, the research will investigate how users interact differently and whether these interfaces lead to more meaningful and engaging experiences with collections.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#">The Impact of Generous Interfaces on User Engagement and Discovery</a></h3>
                        <p>This research project aims to assess the effectiveness of generous interfaces in promoting user engagement and discovery in museum environments. By presenting users with rich, contextual overviews of collections, these interfaces offer multiple entry points to content, potentially enhancing the exploration process. The study will track user interaction patterns to determine whether generous interfaces help users uncover connections between artefacts, foster deeper engagement, and improve overall satisfaction when browsing museum collections. Insights will be used to inform the design of more intuitive and enriching interfaces for cultural institutions.</p>
